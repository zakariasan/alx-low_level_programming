## :desktop_computer:  Tasks

* [0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget](./0-puts_recursion.c) : Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line. Run `man puts` to learn more.
* [1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together](./1-print_rev_recursion.c ) :Write a function that prints a string in reverse.Prototype: `void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);` 
* [2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange](./2-strlen_recursion.c ) :Write a function that returns the length of a string. Run `man strlen` to learn more. 
* [3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling](./3-factorial.c) : Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.
* [4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate](./4-pow_recursion.c ) : Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y. Prototype: `int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);`
* [5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer](./5-sqrt_recursion.c) : Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number. Prototype: `int _sqrt_recursion(int n);`
* [6. Inception. Is it possible?](./6-is_prime_number.c) : Write a function that `returns 1` if the input integer is a `prime number`, otherwise `return 0`.
## :abacus: Advanced_part

* [7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything](./100-is_palindrome.c ) : Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not. Prototype: `int is_palindrome(char *s);`
* [8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...](./101-wildcmp.c) : Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0. Prototype: `int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2);`
