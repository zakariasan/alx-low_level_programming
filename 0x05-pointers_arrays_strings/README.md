## :desktop_computer:  Tasks

* [0. 98 Battery st.](./0-reset_to_98.c) : Write a function that takes a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`. 

* [1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream](./1-swap.c) : Write a function that swaps the values of two integers. Prototype: `void swap_int(int *a, int *b);`

* [2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read](./2-strlen.c) : Write a function that returns the length of a string. Prototype: `int _strlen(char *s);`

* [3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them](./3-puts.c) : Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout. Prototype: `void _puts(char *str);`

* [4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear](./4-print_rev.c) : Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line. Prototype: `void print_rev(char *s);`

* [5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes](./5-rev_string.c) : `void rev_string(char *s);`

* [6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true](./6-puts2.c) : Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line. Prototype: `void puts2(char *str);`

* [7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half](./7-puts_half.c) : Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

* [8. Arrays are not pointers](./8-print_array.c) : rite a function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

* [9. strcpy](./9-strcpy.c) : Prototype: `char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);`

## :abacus: Advanced_part

* [10. Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers](./100-atoi.c) : Write a function that convert a string to an integer.

* [11. Don't hate the hacker, hate the code](./101-keygen.c) :  Create a program that generates random valid passwords for the program the `a.out` code is [101-crackme.](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x04.c)
