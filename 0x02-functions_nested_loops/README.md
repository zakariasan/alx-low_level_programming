## :desktop_computer:  Tasks

* [0.ft_putchar](./0-putchar.c) :Write a program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line.
* [1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game](./1-alphabet.c) : Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
* [2. 10 x alphabet](./2-print_alphabet_x10.c) : Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
* [3. islower](./3-islower.c) : Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
* [4. isalpha](./4-isalpha.c) : Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.
* [5. Sign](./5-sign.c) : Write a function that prints the sign of a number.
* [6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you](./6-abs.c) :Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
* [7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important](./7-print_last_digit.c) :Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
* [8. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life](./8-24_hours.c) : Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
* [9. Learn your times table](./9-times_table.c) : Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
* [10. a + b](./10-add.c) : Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
* [11. 98 Battery Street, the OG](./11-print_to_98.c) : Write a function that prints all natural numbers from `n` to `98`, followed by a new line.

## :abacus: Advanced_part

* [12. The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself](./100-times_table.c) : Write a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.
* [13. Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women](./101-natural.c) : If we list all the natural numbers below `10` that are multiples of `3` or `5`, we get `3`, `5`, `6` and `9`. The sum of these multiples is `23`. Write a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of `3` or `5` below `1024` (excluded), followed by a new line.
* [14. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A](./102-fibonacci.c) : Write a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
* [15. Even Liber Abbaci](./103-fibonacci.c) : Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with `1` and `2`, the first `10` terms will be: `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89`. By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, write a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms, followed by a new line.
* [16. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A+](./104-fibonacci.c) : Write a program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
